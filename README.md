Garment factory Management System which can help factory managers to maintain the records of cloths, Equipment, Export detail history and handle employee details.

INTRODUCTION
In Garment factory managers manage employees, Equipment, Raw materials and Transaction details with customer companies. Employees are divided for security, product making, 
cleaning purpose and common works. For handle this system, here I’m proposing this Garment factory management system software.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Using this Database management system we can reduce workload of managers using soft copy instead hardcopy. Also we can decide what type product selling high and low, what 
type equipment make best quality product and high quantity products, we can put suitable employee for suitable work using analyzing this system we can increase total income. 
So, here I’m trying to optimize problems and increase income by using this garment factory management software.

OBJECTIVE
To make easier way for managing records of cloth product, Employee details, purchase and sales history. And increase the monthly or annual income.

PROBLEM SOLUTION
Here I would like to make a web-based database software which can manipulate and manage garment factory records easily. The app will have an entrance page where we can login 
account. There are four login types. There are Admin login, Managers login, Employee login and Customer Companies login. Only admin can register any above user and admin will 
give username and password to them for login. An admin can manage the details of users and he can update any details of them. And Admin and managers can manage the stock, Raw 
materials, Equipment, transaction, rooms and customer company details. Only admins can view the total income and expense of this system. When employees login, they can mark 
attendance, They may see their pending works, their new task, They can update their finished works. Using this method best employees will be promoted. When customer company 
login, They can see their previous transaction details, New available stocks. Also they can be order for new transaction. Admin and Managers have many authority in this management
system.
